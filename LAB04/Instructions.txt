Deliverables
    Upload your code to LAB04 folder in your class repo.
    Provide the link to your repo below.

1. Create project-spa-backend

    Open folder in which you want to build project-spa-backend (single page application)
        open new terminal
        ensure Express Generator is installed on your machine 
            check using: `npx express-generator` 
            if not installed: `npm install -g express-generator`
                            `npm start'
        once installed, restart VS Code, then type
        'npx express-generator project-spa-backend --view hbs`

2. Create project-spa-frontend

    Open folder in which you want to create project-spa-frontend
        Check if you have Angular CLI installed using 
            `ng version`
        If you have, great! If not, type;
            `npm install -g@angular/cli`
        This will install Angular CLI tools and the global `ng` command
        May take 1-3 minutes
        After installing, verify;
            `ng version`

    In project folder, in terminal, type out
        `ng new project-spa-frontend --no-standalone`
            The reason we are using the `--no-standalone` comment is so that we can use
            we want to use a specific project template for this project (Angular)
            Without this line, the project would be configured using standalone components,
            which is fine for smaller projects, but we want to use templates. 
    When prompted, select 'css style sheet'
    When prompted, select 'N' for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering)
    When prompted, select 'N' for AI.

    The packages will then install. This may take a few minutes.

3. Clear output in terminal;
    `clear`

---
Congrats! Now both your project templates have been made.
---

4. Navigate to project-spa-backend.
    Open project-spa-backend folder in code editing software
    Open project-spa-backend folder in terminal 
        `cd .\project-spa-backend`

5. Restore dependencies 

    Type the following to see how many vulnerabilities exist;
        `npm i`
    The terminal should display vulnerabilities, ranging from Low -> Critical.
    To address these issues, type;
        `npm audit fix --force`
    or
        `npm audit`
    for details. 
    Continue like this, until you have 0 vulnerabilities.

6. Test application using nodemon 
    We are going to test application using nodemon.
    Type the following in terminal to test;
        `nodemon` 
    As long as that runs successfully, go to web browser and type in address bar:
        `localhost:3000`
    You should see welcome page, titled Express, with subtitle, Welcome to Express.
    This means your project template is working. 
    We are going to leave this running in its terminal.
