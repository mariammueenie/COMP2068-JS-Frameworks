Hello, this file is just me writing down steps as I go

That way, I can come back and reference this if ever needed 

So, step 1

1. Open folder in which you want to build project-spa-backend (single page application)
    a. open new terminal
    b. ensure Express Generator is installed on your machine 
        check using: `npx express-generator` 
        if not installed: `npm install -g express-generator`
                          `npm start'
    c. once installed, restart VS Code, then type
       'npx express-generator project-spa-backend --view hbs`
