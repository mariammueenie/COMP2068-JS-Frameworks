  each section can later be converted into an Ionic component

<h1 class="mb-4">About Me</h1>

<!-- General About Section -->
<section class="mb-5">
  <h3 class="mb-3">Who I Am</h3>
  <p>
    My name is Jane Doe. I grew up here in Ontario, and love swimming,
    gardening, comics, and programming. I’m currently a student at Georgian
    College in the Computer Programming Diploma Program. I plan to
    transition into a Computer Science degree at Lakehead University,
    starting next summer.

<!-- Programming Experience -->
<section class="mb-5">
  <h3 class="mb-3">Programming Experience</h3>
  <p>
    This section is a placeholder for now. It is a great candidate for an
    Ionic card list or an accordion where each item represents a language
    or framework (for example: JavaScript, Node.js, Express, C++, Python,
    MongoDB, and so on).
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Work Experience -->
<section class="mb-5">
  <h3 class="mb-3">Work Experience</h3>
  <p>
    Another placeholder section that can later display jobs, volunteer roles,
    internships, or tech projects. In an Ionic version, each experience could
    be its own card or timeline entry.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Future Goals -->
<section class="mb-5">
  <h3 class="mb-3">Future Goals</h3>
  <p>
    Use this section to describe long-term aspirations: completing degrees,
    pursuing specific roles in software development, earning certifications,
    or contributing to open-source projects. In Ionic, this could become a
    simple list or a slide in a swiper component.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Hobbies -->
<section class="mb-5">
  <h3 class="mb-3">Hobbies</h3>
  <p>
    Here you can expand on hobbies such as swimming, gardening, reading
    comics, and any other activities you enjoy. This could be a fun area for
    Ionic animations or image galleries in the future.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Favourite Media -->
<section class="mb-5">
  <h3 class="mb-3">Favourite Media</h3>
  <p>
    Placeholder section for favourite movies, books, shows, music, games,
    or creators. In an Ionic demo, each media type could be shown in a tab
    or a segmented control.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Currently Watching/Reading -->
<section class="mb-5">
  <h3 class="mb-3">Currently Watching / Reading</h3>
  <p>
    Use this area to highlight what you are currently watching or reading.
    Later, this could be connected to a small JSON file or API to show
    “now playing / now reading” entries using Ionic cards.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- Surprise Section -->
<section class="mb-5">
  <h3 class="mb-3">Surprise</h3>
  <p>
    This “Surprise” section is deliberately open-ended. It could contain an
    easter egg, a fun fact, a hidden message, or an interactive Ionic
    component (such as a small game or animation).
